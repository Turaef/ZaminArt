# Active Context

## Current Focus
- Implementing a decorative 3D flooring landing page for Uzbek users
- Ensuring proper component structure and styling
- Completing missing components or functionality
- Applying responsive design principles for all screen sizes

## Recent Changes
- Identified the specific purpose of the Tracker project as a decorative 3D flooring landing page
- Discovered existing component structure:
  - Navbar.jsx
  - Hero.jsx
  - ModelSelector.jsx
  - Gallery.jsx
  - Benefits.jsx
  - Pricing.jsx
  - Contact.jsx
  - FAQ.jsx
  - AnimatedSection.jsx
- Discovered existing asset structure:
  - `/src/assets/images/3d`
  - `/src/assets/images/abstrack`
  - `/src/assets/images/naqshlik`
  - `/src/assets/videos`

## Next Steps
- Review and update each component to ensure it meets requirements
- Add Uzbek language content to all components
- Ensure proper styling with Tailwind CSS
- Implement responsive design for mobile devices
- Check for missing functionality in any components
- Add placeholder images to image directories if needed

## Active Decisions
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling
- Using Vite as the build tool
- Following a single-page, scroll-based design without routing
- Using Uzbek language for all user-facing text
- Using soft green (#7BB66D) as accent color
- Using Inter or Poppins font for typography

## Current Considerations
- Need to ensure proper UTF-8 support for Uzbek text
- Need to optimize image loading for potentially slow connections
- Need to implement proper responsive design for mobile users
- Need to ensure all components interact correctly (e.g., ModelSelector with Gallery)

## Recent Learnings
- Project is a decorative 3D flooring landing page for Uzbek users
- Component structure is mostly in place with key elements defined
- Image asset directories are set up for different flooring types
- Project follows a scroll-based, single-page approach without routing
